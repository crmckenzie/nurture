# Nurture API

# Provides an api spec and a sample implementation for a staged release management process.

[Swagger Docs](swagger.yml)

## TODO

Still need apis

* declaring a manifest ready for staging
* promoting a manifest to a staging environment
* promoting a manifest to a production environment
* rolling back a manifest from production
* rolling back a manifest from staging
* rolling back a manifest from ready

## Comments

* Suggest /releases for the actual release process
	* /releases/applications/:name - get application release history
* Not sure how to noun-ize "staging"
